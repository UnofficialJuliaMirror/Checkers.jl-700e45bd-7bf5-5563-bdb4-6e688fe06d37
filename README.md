Automated testing macros
inspired by a [Julia implementation](https://github.com/pao/QuickCheck.jl)
of Koen Claessen and John Hughes' [QuickCheck](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/)
property-based randomized tester.

## Test Generating Macros

This package provides three macros for test generation:

1. `@test_forall`
2. `@test_formany`
3. `@test_exists`

`@test_forall` takes an expression specifying one or more dummy variables,
discrete sets of values for those variables, and an expression, and tests the
expression substituting every combination of the variables 
(the Cartesian product of their possible value sets). (In the latest Julia,
`@test_forall x in [Collection], P(x)` is quite similar to 
`@test for x in [Collection] P(x) end`,
and we may deprecate / remove it for that reason.)

The expression may be a conditional expression such as `P(x) --> Q(x)`,
in which case truth may be vacuous when `P(x)` is false `\forall x` tested.

`@test_formany` functions like `@test_forall`, but allows quantifying over
infinite sets such as `[a,b] \subset \mathbb R`, etc. by sampling these
sets uniformly at random. It provides additional modifiers to control
how many tests it runs, which are especially helpful for ensuring
that conditional-expression tests are not only passed vacuously.

`@test_exists X` is essentially shorthand for `! (@test_formany !X)`.

### Exhaustion

Note that `@test_formany` and `@test_exists` are not strictly speaking exhaustive
or true universal/existential quantifiers. `@test_formany x Expr(x)` may pass
even when `\exists x` s.t. `Expr(x)` is false, and `@test_exists x Expr(x)` may
fail even under the same circumstances. However, `@test_forall` is exhaustive.

Tests that do not exhaust their universe take additional keyword arguments 
`ntests` and `maxtests` to control how many tests to run.

### Examples

Basic usage:

    @test_forall  x in 1:5,  x^2 < 30
    @test_formany 1 < x < 5, x^2 < 30
    @test_exists  1 < x < 5, x^2 < 30
    
Control how many tests in `@test_formany`:

    @test_formany ntests = 10_000 1 < x < 5, x^2 < 30
    
Test a conditional property, passing only if 100 of the tests are not vacuous:

    @test_formany ntests = 100                    0 < x < Inf, 0 < y < Inf,  x < y --> log(x)<log(y)
  
Test a conditional property, passing only if 100 of the tests are not vacuous, but only allow 100 tests:

    @test_formany ntests = 100 maxtests = 100     0 < x < 10,  0 < y < 10,  x < y --> x^2 < y^2
    
Test a conditional property, passing only if 100 of the test are not vacuous, but allow 100,000 tests:

    @test_formany ntests = 100 maxtests = 100_000 0 < x < 10,  0 < y < 10,  x < y --> x^2 < y^2

Note that while the former (`maxtests=100`) usually fails, the latter (`maxtests=100_000`) passes. 
This is because `@test_formany` generates 100 random pairs of `(x,y)`, but not all of them
are likely to satisfy `x < y`. Therefore when `maxtests=100`, it will not generate
enough pairs to test the consequent of the conditional expression.

See `?@test_forall`, etc. and `examples/examples.jl` for more detailed information. 

### Logging

Test logging is available in `@test_formany` to see which values were actually tested
by using the keyword `logto` and supplying an output path:

    @test_formany logto = "tests.csv" 1<x<5, x^2 < 30

### Output

Test macros output results of type `Base.Test.Pass`, `Base.Test.Fail`, 
or `Base.Test.Error` in order to function seamlessly with `Base.Test.@testset`.

    @testset "Multiple tests" begin 
        @test_forall x in 1:5, x^2 < 30
        @test_forall x in 1:6, x^2 < 30
    end

## See Also

Also of note are these more comprehensive (and we feel complicated) packages. 
Our goal is to provide a lightweight, ready-to-use out-of-the-box alternative:

- [BaseTestAuto](https://github.com/robertfeldt/BaseTestAuto.jl)
- [DataGenerators](https://github.com/simonpoulding/DataGenerators.jl)
